Assume that 1 in 40 million US citizens become president of the United States.

a) Assume that 50% of presidents are left-handed, compared to 10% of the gen-
eral population. What is the probability someone became the president of
the United States, given that he or she is left-handed?

b) Now assume that 15% of US presidents went to Harvard, compared to 1 in
2,000 for the general population. What is the probability that someone became
the president of the United States, given that he or she went to Harvard?

c) Assuming left-handedness and going to Harvard are conditionally indepen-
dent, given whether someone became president, whatâ€™s the probability that
someone became the president of the United States, given that he or she is
left-handed and went to Harvard?
