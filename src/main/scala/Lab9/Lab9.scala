"""
8.5.3/PPE

Letâ€™s model the progression of a student through a series of 10 chapters of
increasing difficulty. Each chapter has a test. The score of the student on the
test depends on how much she learned from the chapter. In addition, the chap-
ters build on one another, so how much the student learns from one chapter
depends on how much she learned from the previous. Model this situation by
using a hidden Markov model and predict the probability that the student will
pass the last test successfully given that she has passed the first three tests.
